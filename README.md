# Module 17 - Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Overview of Project
This challenge used data from the LoanStats CSV file to evaluated credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem because good loans far outnumber the risky loans.

## Analysis Two Jupyter notebook
* [Atomic:] There are 2 Jupyter notebook files credit_risk_ensemble and credit_risk_resampling that  have been created for the model.

## Summary  Accuracy Achieved
* [Atomic:] The ensemble model acheived a recall of 97% (https://github.com/lykkelig/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Ensemble.png). The resampling model only acheived a recall of 73% (https://github.com/lykkelig/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resampling.png)
